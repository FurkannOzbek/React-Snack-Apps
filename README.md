# React Snack Projects

Welcome to the **React Snack Projects** repository! This collection features small, interactive applications created using React. These projects serve as a hands-on way to practice and enhance my skills in React and web development.

## Overview

Each project in this repository focuses on different React concepts, such as:

- Component structure
- State management
- Hooks
- Routing

These mini-projects are designed to reinforce my understanding of React while providing practical examples of how to build user interfaces.
