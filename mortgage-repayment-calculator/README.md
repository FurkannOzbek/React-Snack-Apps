### What I learned 

On top of what I already knew, I figured out easy way to handle seperating thousands with comas and 2 digit after the dot.
```js
 setResultTotalPayment(
        // For the format seperating thousands with comas and after dot only 2 digits
        totalRepayment.toLocaleString("en-US", {
          minimumFractionDigits: 2,
          maximumFractionDigits: 2,
        })
      );
```
